# FFmpeg is a command-line tool that can convert images to video. 
# You need to have FFmpeg installed on your computer and use the 
# terminal to run the commands. Here are some examples of how to use 
# FFmpeg to convert images to video:

# - To convert a sequence of images named 
# test_001.jpg, test_002.jpg, ..., test_100.jpg to a video 
# named output.mp4 with 25 frames per second, you can use this command:

# `ffmpeg -framerate 25 -i test_%03d.jpg output.mp4`

# - To convert a single image named image.jpg to a video 
# named output.mp4 with 10 seconds duration, you can use this command:


# - To add an audio track named music.mp3 to the video output.mp4, 
# you can use this command:

# `ffmpeg -i output.mp4 -i music.mp3 -c:v copy -c:a aac -shortest output_with_audio.mp4`
